# linear-risk-model
Created a Risk score model for retinopathy in diabetes patients.

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maneshkokare/retinopathy-dataset/data

Important insight derived:
1. Negative Coefficient of age_x_cholesterol highlights the fact that effect of high cholesterol becomes less important for older patients compared to younger patients
2. The opposite is true for age and systolic_blood_pressure
